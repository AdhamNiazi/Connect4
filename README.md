# Connect4 Game with AI

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Connect4 game with several AI algorithms. You can play against different types of AI, including:

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **Minimax** (for comparison with Alpha-Beta Pruning)
- **AI vs. AI**: Let the algorithms play against each other

## Features

- **Play Against AI**: Choose between MCTS, Alpha-Beta Pruning, or Minimax.
- **AI vs. AI**: Watch different AI algorithms compete against each other.
- **Interactive Command Line Interface**: Play the game and make your moves through the terminal.


##AI Algorithms
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Uses random simulations to make decisions. This method can handle complex decision-making scenarios by sampling many possible future game states.

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimized version of the Minimax algorithm that eliminates branches in the game tree that don't need to be explored.

- **Minimax: The basic decision-making algorithm used for comparison with Alpha-Beta Pruning. It demonstrates slower performance compared to the optimized version.
